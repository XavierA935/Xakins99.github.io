        <h2>Origin</h2>
 
     <p>
      I was born in New Jersey but my parents didnt like raising me there so they moved us to georgia.
      Which now i have lived here for 17 years. Growing up here has been pleasant just wonder how different my life would be if i stayed.But one thing that i know for sure whether im in Georgia or Jersey i have an awesome family will and always impact no matter the location
